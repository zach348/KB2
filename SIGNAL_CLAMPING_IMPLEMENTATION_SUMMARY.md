# Signal Clamping Implementation Summary

## Date: June 28, 2025

### Overview
Successfully implemented signal clamping for the PD controller in the Adaptive Difficulty Manager (ADM) to prevent jarring difficulty changes during gameplay.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Configuration Addition (`GameConfiguration.swift`)
- Added `domMaxSignalPerRound: CGFloat = 0.15` property
- This limits PD controller output to 15% of normalized range per round
- Configurable to allow different clamping limits for testing/tuning

#### 2. PD Controller Update (`AdaptiveDifficultyManager.swift`)
- Modified `modulateDOMsWithProfiling()` method to apply signal clamping
- Calculates raw signal first, then clamps to Â±domMaxSignalPerRound
- Added logging to indicate when clamping is applied: "(CLAMPED)" suffix

#### 3. Test Suite (`ADMSignalClampingTests.swift`)
- Fixed configuration references (removed non-existent properties)
- Increased session duration from 300s to 900s (15 minutes) for adequate rounds
- Updated warmup phase handling to use `warmupPhaseProportion` instead of direct round counts
- All 6 tests now pass successfully

### Key Implementation Details

1. **Signal Clamping Logic**:
   ```swift
   let rawSignal = performanceGap * confidenceAdjustedRate * gainModifier
   let finalSignal = max(-config.domMaxSignalPerRound, min(config.domMaxSignalPerRound, rawSignal))
   ```

2. **Diagnostic Output**:
   - Shows both raw and clamped signals
   - Indicates when clamping occurred with "(CLAMPED)" marker
   - Helps identify when PD controller wants larger adjustments

3. **Test Coverage**:
   - Tests clamping in both positive (hardening) and negative (easing) directions
   - Verifies custom clamp limits work correctly
   - Ensures exploration nudges still respect position bounds (0-1)
   - Confirms clamping is logged appropriately

### Benefits

1. **Smoother Gameplay**: Prevents sudden difficulty spikes that could frustrate players
2. **Predictable Adaptation**: Maximum 15% change per round ensures gradual progression
3. **Tunable**: domMaxSignalPerRound can be adjusted based on playtesting feedback
4. **Transparent**: Clear logging shows when the system wants larger changes but is being limited

### Next Steps

Consider monitoring game sessions to see:
- How often clamping occurs in real gameplay
- Whether 15% is the optimal limit
- If different DOMs should have different clamp limits

The implementation maintains the sophistication of the PD controller while ensuring player experience remains smooth and enjoyable.
