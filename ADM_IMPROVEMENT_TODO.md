# Adaptive Difficulty Manager (ADM) Improvement Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the remaining and future improvements for the ADM. The core systems for performance history, hysteresis, confidence-based adaptation, and persistence have been successfully implemented. The focus now shifts to advanced features and comprehensive testing.

---

## ✅ Completed Features

### Phase 1: Foundation - Performance History Tracking
- **Status**: Implemented
- **Details**: The ADM now tracks performance history, calculating trend, average, and variance to inform adaptation decisions. This moves beyond single-sample decision making.

### Phase 1.5: KPI Weight Interpolation
- **Status**: Implemented
- **Details**: KPI weights are now smoothly interpolated across a defined arousal range (0.55-0.85), eliminating the hard switch at arousal 0.7.

### Phase 2: Trend-Based Adaptation
- **Status**: Implemented
- **Details**: The ADM uses a weighted combination of current performance, historical average, and performance trend to create a more stable and predictive `adaptivePerformanceScore`.

### Phase 2.5: DOM Priority Weight Interpolation
- **Status**: Implemented
- **Details**: The rigid, hierarchical DOM adjustment has been replaced with a flexible, weighted budget system. DOM target priorities are interpolated based on arousal, allowing for smoother, more context-appropriate difficulty changes.

### Phase 3: Basic Hysteresis
- **Status**: Implemented
- **Details**: Hysteresis is in place to prevent rapid oscillation of difficulty. The system now requires a number of stable rounds before reversing adaptation direction.

### Phase 4: Advanced Confidence-Based Adaptation
- **Status**: Implemented
- **Details**: The ADM calculates a confidence score based on performance variance, direction stability, and history size. This score scales the adaptation rate and dynamically widens the performance thresholds, making the system more cautious when uncertain.

### Phase 4.5: Cross-Session Persistence
- **Status**: Implemented
- **Details**: The ADM now saves and loads its state (including performance history and DOM positions) across sessions for a specific user, allowing for continuous adaptation over time. Recency weighting is applied to older data.

### Session-Aware Adaptation (Formerly Phase 5.1)
- **Status**: Implemented
- **Details**: A two-phase session system is now active:
  1.  **Warmup Phase**: A brief initial period with a higher performance target and faster adaptation rate to quickly calibrate to the user's current state.
  2.  **Standard Phase**: The main session phase with normal adaptation parameters.

### Fatigue Detection & Mitigation
- **Status**: Removed
- **Details**: The experimental fatigue detection feature was removed to simplify the model and focus on the core two-phase session structure.

## ▶️ Future Work & Next Steps

The foundational ADM is complete. The following advanced features are proposed for future development.

### Step 5.2: DOM-Specific Performance Profiling
- **Status**: Partially Implemented (Phase 3.5 of 6 complete)
- **Goal**: To understand which difficulty parameters are most impactful for a user by tracking performance at different settings for each DOM target. This moves the ADM beyond a single overall performance score to a more nuanced model of player skill.
- **Completed**:
  - ✅ Phase 1: Data structures and configuration (200-entry buffer for long-term history)
  - ✅ Phase 2: Passive data collection in `recordIdentificationPerformance`
  - ✅ Phase 3: Adaptation jitter mechanism for DOM value exploration
  - ✅ Phase 3.5: Cross-session persistence of DOM profiles
- **Remaining**:
  - ⚪ Phase 4: Profile-based adaptation logic using weighted linear regression
  - ⚪ Phase 5: Feature flag activation and integration
  - ⚪ Phase 6: Legacy code cleanup
- **Key Design Decisions**:
  - 200-entry buffer size to maintain ~20 sessions of history
  - Timestamp-based recency weighting for regression analysis
  - Minimum 7 data points required before adaptation signals activate
  - Standard deviation threshold to ensure sufficient DOM value variance

### Step 5.3: Enhanced Configuration and Presets
- **Status**: Not Started
- **Goal**: Introduce presets (e.g., Novice, Speed Focus, Precision Focus) that adjust the ADM's core parameters. This allows for different training goals and user experiences.
- **Implementation Sketch**:
  ```swift
  enum PlayerProfile {
      case novice, intermediate, expert, adaptive
      
      var adaptationConfiguration: AdaptationConfiguration {
          switch self {
          case .novice:
              return AdaptationConfiguration(
                  adaptationRate: 0.8,
                  confidenceThreshold: 0.3,
                  historyWeight: 0.4
              )
          // ... other profiles
          }
      }
  }
  ```

### Step 5.4: Advanced Analytics and Logging
- **Status**: Not Started
- **Goal**: Log more comprehensive adaptation decision events for offline analysis and visualization.
- **Implementation Sketch**:
  ```swift
  // Log comprehensive adaptation events
  DataLogger.shared.logAdaptationDecision(
      performanceScore: score,
      confidence: confidence,
      adaptationSignal: signal,
      domAdjustments: adjustments,
      historicalContext: getHistorySnapshot()
  )
  ```

## Testing Strategy (Ongoing)

As new features are added, the corresponding tests must be implemented. The existing test suite covers all completed features.

-   **Unit Tests**: For specific functions and edge cases.
-   **Integration Tests**: For full adaptation cycles and feature interactions.
-   **A/B Testing Framework**: For comparing different configurations.
-   **Real-World Validation**: Through session recordings and user feedback.
