## 2. How We Use Your Information

The anonymized data we collect is used for the following purposes:

- **In-App Experience:** To provide you with visualizations of your performance and progress over time, and to power the adaptive difficulty algorithms that tailor the cognitive training to your needs.
- **Cloud Storage for Research:** Anonymized data is transmitted to a secure cloud backend for aggregation and analysis. This research helps us understand cognitive performance trends and improve the effectiveness of the App. All data is handled in accordance with strict privacy and security standards.
