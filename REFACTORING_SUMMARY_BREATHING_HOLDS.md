# Breathing Hold Duration Refactoring Summary

## Date: June 14, 2025

### Overview
Refactored the breathing guidance system to calculate hold durations as proportions of inhale/exhale durations, rather than using fixed min/max ranges. This creates a more cohesive breathing pattern where holds scale naturally with the breath phases.

### Changes Made

#### 1. GameConfiguration.swift
- **Added new proportional parameters:**
  - `holdAfterInhaleProportion_LowArousal`: 0.30 (30% of inhale duration at low arousal)
  - `holdAfterInhaleProportion_HighArousal`: 0.05 (5% of inhale duration at high arousal)
  - `holdAfterExhaleProportion_LowArousal`: 0.50 (50% of exhale duration at low arousal)
  - `holdAfterExhaleProportion_HighArousal`: 0.20 (20% of exhale duration at high arousal)

- **Retained (for potential future use):**
  - Old `_Min`/`_Max` constants for hold durations
  - These may be removed in a future cleanup if confirmed unnecessary

#### 2. GameScene.swift
- **Updated `updateDynamicBreathingParameters()` method:**
  - Now calculates hold durations as proportions of inhale/exhale durations
  - Interpolates proportions based on normalized breathing arousal
  - Example: At low arousal (0.0), hold after inhale = 30% of inhale duration
  - Example: At high arousal (1.0), hold after inhale = 5% of inhale duration

- **Updated `runBreathingCycleAction()` method:**
  - Applies proportional hold calculations when `needsVisualDurationUpdate` flag is set
  - Ensures visual and haptic patterns stay synchronized

#### 3. ArousalManager.swift
- **Updated `updateDynamicBreathingParameters()` method:**
  - Mirrors the same proportional calculation logic as GameScene
  - Maintains consistency across the codebase

### Benefits of This Approach

1. **Natural Scaling**: Hold durations automatically scale with breath phase durations
2. **Simplified Configuration**: Only need to tune proportions, not absolute values
3. **Better User Experience**: Creates more natural breathing patterns where holds feel appropriate to the breath length
4. **Easier Maintenance**: Fewer parameters to manage and test

### Testing
- All integration tests pass successfully
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Dynamic breathing parameters update correctly based on arousal levels

### Example Breathing Patterns

**At Low Arousal (0.0):**
- Inhale: 3.5s → Hold: 1.05s (30%)
- Exhale: 6.5s → Hold: 3.25s (50%)

**At Medium Arousal (0.175):**
- Inhale: 4.25s → Hold: 0.74s (17.5%)
- Exhale: 5.75s → Hold: 2.01s (35%)

**At Tracking Threshold (0.35):**
- Inhale: 5.0s → Hold: 0.25s (5%)
- Exhale: 5.0s → Hold: 1.0s (20%)

### Next Steps (Optional)
1. Remove legacy `_Min`/`_Max` hold duration constants if confirmed unnecessary
2. Fine-tune the proportion values based on user testing
3. Consider adding configuration options for custom breathing patterns
