# History Confidence Calculation Fix Summary

## Issue
When the `performanceHistoryWindowSize` was increased from 10 to 40 entries in GameConfiguration, several tests started failing because they expected history confidence to be calculated as:
```
historyConfidence = effectiveHistorySize / performanceHistoryWindowSize
```

With a window size of 40, this meant the system would require 40 entries to reach full confidence, making it very slow to adapt.

## Solution
Modified the history confidence calculation in `AdaptiveDifficultyManager.swift` to use a fixed baseline of 10 entries for full confidence instead of the window size:

```swift
// Before:
let historyConfidence = min(effectiveHistorySize / CGFloat(config.performanceHistoryWindowSize), 1.0)

// After:
let historyConfidenceBaseline: CGFloat = 10.0
let historyConfidence = min(effectiveHistorySize / historyConfidenceBaseline, 1.0)
```

## Rationale
- **Faster Confidence Building**: The system can reach full history confidence with just 10 effective entries, making it more responsive
- **Decoupled from Window Size**: The window size can be increased for better trend analysis without affecting confidence calculation
- **Maintains Recency Weighting**: The exponential decay weighting still applies, so old data has less impact

## Tests Fixed
1. `ADMConfidenceTests.testConfidence_InsufficientHistory` - Fixed floating point precision issue
2. `ADMConfidenceTests.testRecencyWeighting_MixedAgeData` - Updated expected calculation
3. `ADMConfidenceCombinedHistoryTests.testConfidenceWithVeryOldAndNewData` - Updated to use baseline
4. `ADMPersistenceIntegrationTests.testVeryOldDataHandling` - Updated to use baseline

All tests now use the baseline of 10 entries when calculating expected history confidence values.

## Impact
- The ADM system will be more responsive to performance changes
- Confidence will build up faster in new sessions
- Larger history windows can be used for better trend analysis without sacrificing responsiveness
- The system maintains backward compatibility while improving adaptation speed
