# ADM Persistence Loading Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved
Fixed persistence loading in AdaptiveDifficultyManager where DOM positions were not being correctly loaded from saved state.

## Root Cause
The ADM constructor was always using the default user ID from `UserIDManager.getUserId()` regardless of what userId was set after construction. This caused a mismatch between the userId used for saving and loading persistence data.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated ADM Constructor
Added optional `userId` parameter to allow specifying user ID at construction time:

```swift
init(
    configuration: GameConfiguration,
    initialArousal: CGFloat,
    sessionDuration: TimeInterval,
    userId: String? = nil  // New parameter
)
```

### 2. Updated userId Assignment
Changed from always using default to respecting provided parameter:

```swift
// Before:
self.userId = UserIDManager.getUserId()

// After:
self.userId = userId ?? UserIDManager.getUserId()
```

### 3. Test Updates
Updated all test code to pass userId during ADM construction rather than setting it afterward.

## Verification
Created comprehensive tests that verify:
1. DOM positions are correctly saved to persistence
2. DOM positions are correctly loaded when creating a new ADM instance
3. Warmup scaling is properly applied to loaded positions when warmup is enabled

## Impact
- Persistence now works correctly for both production code (using default user ID) and tests (using custom user IDs)
- No breaking changes to existing code - the userId parameter is optional and defaults to current behavior
- Fixes issues with cross-session difficulty continuity

## Files Modified
- `KB2/AdaptiveDifficultyManager.swift` - Added userId parameter to constructor
- `KB2Tests/ADMPersistenceLoadingDebugTest.swift` - Created new test file to verify fix

## Commit Message
```
Fix ADM persistence loading by adding userId parameter to constructor

- Add optional userId parameter to AdaptiveDifficultyManager init
- Ensure userId is set before attempting to load persisted state
- Update tests to pass userId during construction
- Add comprehensive persistence loading tests
