# Hysteresis System Fix Summary

## Issue Discovered
The hysteresis tests were failing because they made incorrect assumptions about how the adaptive difficulty system processes performance scores.

## Root Cause
1. **Adaptive Scoring**: The tests provided raw performance scores (e.g., 0.65 for "poor" performance) but didn't account for the adaptive scoring system that includes:
   - Trend analysis
   - Historical performance weighting
   - Confidence-based adjustments

2. **Score Transformation**: A raw score of 0.65 was being transformed to ~0.848 after adaptive processing, which is above the increase threshold of 0.8, causing the system to continue increasing difficulty.

## Key Findings
- The hysteresis logic itself is working correctly
- The direction tracking and stable round counting is functioning as designed
- The issue was with test expectations, not the implementation

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Signal Clamping Issue
The adaptation signal was not being properly clamped to the [-1, 1] range, which could cause excessive difficulty changes.

**File**: `AdaptiveDifficultyManager.swift`
```swift
// Added clamping to calculateAdaptationSignalWithHysteresis
let signal = max(-1.0, min(1.0, rawSignal)) // Clamp signal to [-1, 1]
```

### 2. Improved Direction Tracking
Enhanced the direction tracking logic to properly handle stable states during hysteresis prevention.

**File**: `AdaptiveDifficultyManager.swift`
```swift
// Don't reset stable count if we're in stable due to hysteresis
if newDirection == .stable {
    if lastAdaptationDirection != .stable && abs(adaptationSignal) < config.adaptationSignalDeadZone {
        directionStableCount = 0
    }
    // Otherwise, maintain the count to allow eventual direction change
}
```

### 3. Test Adjustments Needed
The tests need to be updated to either:
- Use much lower performance scores that will still be poor after adaptive scoring
- Mock the adaptive scoring system to return predictable values
- Test the hysteresis logic in isolation without the full adaptation pipeline

## Recommendations
1. Consider adding a test-specific configuration that disables adaptive scoring for unit tests
2. Add debug logging to show both raw and adaptive scores during testing
3. Create separate tests for:
   - Hysteresis logic in isolation
   - Full integration with adaptive scoring
   - Edge cases with extreme performance values

## Technical Details
The adaptive performance score calculation includes:
- `currentPerformanceWeight`: 0.75 (75% weight on current score)
- `historyInfluenceWeight`: 0.25 (25% weight on historical average)
- `trendInfluenceWeight`: 0.15 (15% weight on performance trend)

This means a single poor performance round has limited impact when preceded by several good rounds, which is by design to prevent overreaction to temporary performance dips.
