# Mid-Exhale Hold Refactoring Summary

## Date: June 15, 2025

### Overview
Refactored the breathing guidance system to reposition the first breath hold to occur *during* the exhalation phase, creating a more complex 5-phase breathing cycle. This change was implemented to align with new specifications for the breathing exercise.

### New Breathing Cycle
The breathing cycle now follows this 5-phase sequence:
1.  **Inhale**
2.  **Partial Exhale** (a brief, initial exhalation)
3.  **Hold 1** (mid-exhale)
4.  **Remainder of Exhale**
5.  **Hold 2** (post-exhale)

### Changes Made

#### 1. GameConfiguration.swift
- **Added new tunable parameter:**
  - `preHoldExhaleProportion`: Defines the percentage of the total exhale duration that occurs before the first hold. Default is `0.05` (5%).

#### 2. GameScene.swift
- **Updated `BreathingPhase` Enum:**
  - Redefined to include the new 5-phase cycle: `inhale`, `partialExhale`, `holdMidExhale`, `remainderExhale`, `holdAfterExhale`.
- **Rebuilt `runBreathingCycleAction()`:**
  - The animation sequence was entirely restructured to handle the 5 phases.
  - The exhale animation is now split into two parts (`partialExhale` and `remainderExhale`), separated by the `holdMidExhale` action.
- **Updated `updateBreathingPhase()`:**
  - The UI cue label now correctly displays "Exhale" for both the partial and remainder exhale phases, and "Hold" for both hold phases.
- **Updated `generateBreathingHapticPattern()`:**
  - The haptic feedback sequence was modified to match the new 5-phase cycle, ensuring that the physical feedback remains synchronized with the visual animation.

### Benefits of This Approach
1.  **Increased Complexity**: The new pattern is more complex and may offer different physiological effects.
2.  **Tunable Control**: The `preHoldExhaleProportion` parameter allows for fine-tuning of the breathing exercise without code changes.
3.  **Maintainable Structure**: The code remains organized and readable despite the increased complexity of the animation and haptic sequences.

### Testing
- All integration tests pass successfully.
- The new 5-phase breathing cycle is visually and haptically correct.
- No breaking changes were introduced to other parts of the application.

### Next Steps
- The new breathing pattern can now be tested with users to evaluate its effectiveness and subjective feel.
- The `preHoldExhaleProportion` value can be adjusted based on feedback.
